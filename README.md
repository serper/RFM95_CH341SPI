# CH341SPI

## Overview

CH341SPI is a C++ library designed to facilitate communication with SPI devices using the CH341 USB to SPI adapter. This library provides an abstraction layer for SPI communication, making it easier to interface with various SPI devices on Linux systems.

## Features

- **SPI Communication**: Supports standard SPI communication protocols.
- **GPIO Control**: Allows control of GPIO pins for interrupt handling.
- **Cross-Platform**: Designed to work on Linux systems with spidev support.
- **Modular Design**: Easily extendable to support additional SPI devices.

## Installation

To build and install the CH341SPI library, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CH341SPI.git
    cd CH341SPI
    ```

2. Create a build directory and navigate to it:
    ```sh
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```

3. Run CMake to configure the project:
    ```sh
    cmake ..
    ```

4. Build the project:
    ```sh
    make
    ```

5. Install the library:
    ```sh
    sudo make install
    ```

## Usage

### Creating an SPI Interface

To create an SPI interface using the CH341 adapter, include the necessary headers and use the `SPIFactory` class:

```cpp
#include "SPIFactory.hpp"

std::unique_ptr<SPIInterface> spi = SPIFactory::createLinuxSPI("/dev/spidev0.0", 1000000, 0);
```

### Communicating with SPI Devices

You can use the `transfer` method to send and receive data from SPI devices:

```cpp
std::vector<uint8_t> write_data = {0x01, 0x02, 0x03};
std::vector<uint8_t> read_data = spi->transfer(write_data);
```

### Controlling GPIO Pins

The library also provides methods to control GPIO pins:

```cpp
spi->pinMode(17, SPIInterface::OUTPUT);
spi->digitalWrite(17, true);
bool pin_value = spi->digitalRead(17);
```
